    "The source of my dataset is Foodpanda, an online food delivery platform. It was published on Kaggle. Data was gathered from Foodpanda's historical records, including customer information, restuarant details, delivery times, ratings, and payment methods. Then it was anonymized and cleaned for research use. This dataset interests me because it gives insight into consumer behavior.\n",
