    "# Seaborn\n",
    "Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on `matplotlib` (which we have used a little bit before). It provides a higher-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Here's a brief history and overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Origin**: Seaborn was created by Michael Waskom, who started the project during his graduate studies. The library was intended to make visualizations that are directly related to statistical analyses more accessible and to improve upon some of the default aesthetics provided by `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name Origin**: The name \"Seaborn\" is actually a reference to a character named Sam Seaborn from the television show \"The West Wing\". Michael Waskom, the creator, has confirmed this in discussions online.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aesthetics and Themes**: One of the first things users notice about Seaborn is its capability to produce visually pleasing plots with just default settings. Seaborn comes with several themes and color palettes that are designed to reveal patterns in data in a manner that's visually appealing and easily interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functionalities**: Over the years, Seaborn has introduced many functionalities that simplify complex visualization tasks. "

    "## Box plots vs histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "Box plots and histograms show similar but not identical information.  Here are some strengths and weaknesses of both.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Histogram:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mode:** A histogram can clearly show unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal distributions, which are distributions with one, two, or multiple peaks, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skewness:** The direction and degree of skewness (asymmetry) can be easily discerned from a histogram. You can visually determine if the distribution is skewed to the left (negatively skewed) or to the right (positively skewed).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaps and Outliers:** While histograms aren’t the best for identifying individual outliers, they are excellent for spotting gaps in data or unusual spikes, which could suggest possible outliers or data collection issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Shape:** The overall shape of the distribution (bell-shaped, uniform, exponential, etc.) can be inferred from a histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Box Plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Median:** The central line inside the box represents the median of the dataset. It gives a clear indication of the dataset's central tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interquartile Range (IQR):** The size of the box represents the IQR, which is the range between Q1 and Q3. This shows the spread of the central 50% of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers:** One of the key advantages of box plots is the ability to easily visualize outliers. Data points outside the \"whiskers\" are typically considered outliers and are often plotted individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spread and Symmetry:** The spread of the data can be inferred from the range (difference between the minimum and maximum) and the IQR. The symmetry of the distribution about the median can also be inferred to some degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparisons:** Box plots are particularly useful when comparing distributions across groups. Side-by-side box plots can quickly reveal differences in medians, spreads, and the presence of outliers across multiple groups.\n"

    "A **dendrogram** is a tree‑like diagram that visualizes the process and results of **hierarchical clustering**. Here’s how it works, using the Titanic dataset as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute pairwise distances**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * First, you select the variables you care about (e.g., passenger class, age, fare, survival status) and compute a “distance” or dissimilarity between every pair of passengers.\n",
    "   * Passengers who are similar (say, both are children in 3rd class) have a small distance; very different passengers (an elderly 1st‑class survivor vs. a young 3rd‑class non‑survivor) have a large distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iteratively merge clusters**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Initially, each passenger is its own cluster.\n",
    "   * At each step, you merge the two clusters that are closest together.\n",
    "   * For example, the two children in 3rd class might be the first to join; later, that small child cluster might merge with other 3rd‑class clusters, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Record merge heights**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Each time two clusters merge, you record the distance (or dissimilarity) at which the merge happened.\n",
    "   * In the Titanic example, a merge at low height might reflect very similar fare and age; a merge at high height might join a wealthy 1st‑class adult group with a low‑fare group.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Draw the tree**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * On the horizontal axis, you list all individual passengers (or cluster labels).\n",
    "   * On the vertical axis, you plot the “height” at which each merge occurred.\n",
    "   * Lines (branches) connect merged clusters, with the vertical position indicating the dissimilarity threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interpret clusters**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * By “cutting” the dendrogram at a chosen height, you decide how many clusters to keep.\n",
    "   * For instance, cutting near the bottom might separate survivors vs. non‑survivors; cutting higher might split by class or age group.\n",
